# Sun Ling Yue - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
I have worked on a project in year 2020. This project is about creating a command line program to manage
your finances. We are a team of five NUS students. Each of us has chosen a unique feature to work on. For my
part, I have created a save and load manager that maintain copies of past saves to be loaded at will.
