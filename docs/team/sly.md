# Sun Ling Yue - Project Portfolio Page

## Overview
I have worked on a project in year 2020. This project was about creating a command line program to manage
your finances. We were a team of five NUS students. Each of us has chosen a unique feature to work on. For my
part, I have created a save and load manager that maintain copies of past saves to be loaded at will.

### Summary of Contributions
#### Code contribution

#### Enhancement implemented
I have implemented saving and loading of tracker classes upon entry and exit from the program in version one as well as some main menu implementation.
In version two, I have implemented save Manager which allows main menu to access my save feature and use it to create multiple backup saves and load them at will.
I also made sure in version two that saving is done every time a change is made instead of only at the end when program exits. Lastly, I also partially worked on
saving log files.

#### Contribution to documentation
My contribution for User Guide is on a section called save Manager. It details how to use the save manager with given examples.

#### Contribution to developer's guide
My contribution of developer's guide is on a section called Storage utiliy as well as Save Manager manual testing and some user stories related to saving and
loading. Under the Save Manager section I also have created a class diagram and sequence diagram. Under Storage component I have also created an architecture
diagram and it's explaination.

#### Contribution to team based tasks
Contribution to weekly docs where we plan user stories next milestones etc.
